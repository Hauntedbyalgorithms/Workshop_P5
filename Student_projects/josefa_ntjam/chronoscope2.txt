In « The Dead Past », Asimov describes a chronoscope, a device that allow direct observation of past events. 
The chronoscope turns out to be of only limited use for archeologists, since it can look only a couple of centuries into the past. 
However, people soon discover that it can easily be tuned to the most recent past, with a time lag of fractions of a second.
Throughy the chronoscope, one can observe any event almost in real time. 
It is the end of privacy, for the dead past is only a synonym for « the living present’, as one of characters remarks rather philosophically.
